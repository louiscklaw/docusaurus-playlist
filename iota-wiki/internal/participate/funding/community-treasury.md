# Community Treasury

![Community Treasury](https://github.com/iota-community/Community-Governance/raw/main/assets/iota_community_treasury.png)

The community treasury is envisioned to be a project where the community can apply for funding and the community can also decide if they want to approve the funding.

## Initial Voting

First there will be an initial voting on if the community wants to have a community treasury or if they want to burn the unclaimed tokens. You can read more about the unclaimed tokens in [this](https://blog.iota.org/unclaimed-tokens-community-treasury-and-iota-as-faq/) blog post from the IF.

The initial voting will work with the tools currently available on mainnet. So it will "just" be a plugin that node operators can run to count votes and people can vote for BUILD or BURN in Firefly.
You can read more about this topic [here](https://github.com/iota-community/Community-Governance).

## DAO

If the community votes for BUILD a DAO(decentralized autonomous organization) will be build.
The DAO will use available IOTA tools like ISCP and identity to be the fairest and best solution possible.
