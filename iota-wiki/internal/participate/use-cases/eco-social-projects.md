### EnergieKnip

EnergieKnip rewards citizens of Emmen, a municipality of about 100,000 citizens in the northeast of the Netherlands, with digital tokens for anonymously sharing data about energy-saving measures used at home. The tokens can be used to buy energy-saving devices in local stores. Dutch-based BlockchainLab Drenthe has launched this large-scale real-world adoption of IOTA technology.
