## The IOTA Discord Channels

This site maps the categories of the IOTA Discord and will guide you to find the channels specific to your interest. The IOTA Discord is divided into **Categories** and **Channels**. The list of **Categories** and **Channels** are dynamic and change with time.

The Categories as of October 2021 are:

**IOTA FOUNDATION OFFICIAL**

The channels in this category are announcements channels.

**START HERE**

The channels in this category have important information. Make sure to start there and read the information. The **#help** channel is there to get community support.

**COMMUNITY**

The channels here are for our community to find like-minded people and discuss all things IOTA.

**REGIONAL COMMUNITIES**

The communities have dedicated regional channels for the AMERICAS, Asia, and EMEA. There are also language-specific channels for more active communities. You can get write access to these channels in the **#get-your-badge** channel.

**GOVERNANCE**

Here, the IOTA community shares approaches and develops the upcoming vote for or against a community-controlled governance structure. Learn more about the IOTA Treasury Governance initiative [here on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/ondz3u/iota_treasury_governance_info_thread/).

**RESEARCH & ACADEMIA**

The channels here are dedicated to research topics about the Tangle and the IOTA protocol.

**IOTA PROJECTS**

Here are the dedicated discussion and development channels for all IOTA projects, from the client libraries to the permanode or identity and smart contracts. Developers and builders are invited to share their ideas and find answers for IOTA building blocks.

**IOTA FOUNDATION TEAMS**

Includes categories and channels dedicated to the communication with and between IOTA Foundation developers.

**BEE TEAM**

Bee is a framework for IOTA nodes, clients, and applications in Rust. The Bee team meets here.

**COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT**

These channels are dedicated to the developers and builders in our ecosystem with a list of programming language-specific channels, community activities, and development like the NFT-marketplace.

**IOTA IMPACT**

In the channels from this category, we discuss initiatives that have an impact on the IOTA ecosystem, like digital assets, diversity, market adoption, or social impact.

**IOTA EXPERIENCE TEAMS**

Here are the channels of the IOTA X-Teams: a group of dedicated community members that work together with members of the IOTA Foundation throughout different stages of development. [Learn more about the IOTA X-Teams](https://blog.iota.org/iota-experience-team-the-first-year-recap/) and join the initiatives.

## IOTA Discord custom commands

The IOTA discord server uses the [Dyno-bot](https://dyno.gg/). This bot is a beneficial tool to manage discord servers. Besides essential functions for the admins of the server, it hosts the ability to execute custom commands for every user. We have enabled several commands to display pre-configured messages containing answers to the discord's most asked questions.

A custom command message can be initiated by using the `!` sign directly followed by the `command text.`

Here is the list of currently availeable commands:

- `!banhammered`
  - http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/024/724/ban_hammer.jpg
- `!becomemod`
  - Mods for the official communication channels of IOTA are carefully chosen by the IOTA founders and are based on their trustworthiness and contribution to the community, there are no applications to become a mod. If you contribute to the community you might eventually be approached to become one if you want to. Please do not ask us to become a mod.
  - http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/024/724/ban_hammer.jpg
- `!bep`
  - If you exchange tokens on Binance and it does not recognize Firefly's address, then you have bought IOTA tokens wrapped on Binance's BEP-20 network. To get tokens to Firefly one needs IOTA tokens that reside on IOTA's network (called the Tangle). To achieve this, send the tokens back to Binance and withdraw them to the Tangle network.
Should Binance have issues with withdrawals, get in touch with Binance's support.

  - This can occasionally happen and will be fixed in further releases. To fix it and get direct access to your funds do the following: Make sure that you have a backup of your    24 Seed words and also the stronghold backup file created in the initial profile setup for the migration. If you are sure you have this please uninstall Firefly from your  operating System.

  - Windows: "C:\Users[username]\AppData\Roaming\Firefly 
  - Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/Firefly 
  - Linux: ~/.config/Firefly 

  - After you have deleted those folder please install Firefly again from the newest release on the Firefly Website, create a profile and use the “Migrate or restore a wallet” Function.

  - Now use your Firefly recovery phrase or your File backup (stronghold File)
  - To restore your Migration profile.
  - The funds will appear as Balance and you can start using Firefly with your tokens.
- `!finding-balance`
  - If your Ledger does not generate addresses on Windows while finding balance, disconnect the device and try again. Failing that, restart Firefly.
- `!houserules`
  - Please read the house rules in {#read-me-first}
- `!invitelink`
  - You can invite others to this discord with this link: https://discord.iota.org - The generated invite link is only valid for 1 person for a limited amount of time.
