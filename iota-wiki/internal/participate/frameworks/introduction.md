# IOTA Frameworks

The IOTA foundation maintains and develops a collection of frameworks building on the Tangle.

## List of Frameworks

![Layer2-frameworks](/img/learn/layer2-frameworks.png)

- [Streams](/participate/frameworks/streams):
  Streams is an organizational tool for structuring and navigating secure data through the Tangle. Streams organizes data by ordering it in a uniform and interoperable structure.
- [Identity](/participate/frameworks/identity):
  The IOTA Identity framework implements the most common standards and patterns for Decentralized Identity in both a DLT agnostic and iota method specification manner.
- [Smart Contracts](/participate/frameworks/smart-contracts):
  The IOTA Smart Contract Protocol (ISCP) is the implementation of Smart Contracts on IOTA.
- [Access](/participate/frameworks/access):
  IOTA Access is an open-source framework used to build access control systems for smart devices. It is designed to work with any IoT resource, whether it's a vehicle, smart lock, or embedded sensor.
- [Stronghold](/participate/frameworks/stronghold):
  A library for secure secret handling and storage.
- [Oracles](/participate/frameworks/oracles):
  IOTA Oracles bring off-chain data to decentralized applications and smart contracts on the IOTA network.
