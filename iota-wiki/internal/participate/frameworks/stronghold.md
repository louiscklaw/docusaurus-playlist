# Stronghold

Stronghold is an open-source software library that was originally built to protect IOTA Seeds, but can be used to protect any digital secret.

It is a secure database for working with cryptography, which ensures that secrets (like private keys) are never revealed - but can be used according to best practices.

It provides its own peer-to-peer communication layer, so that different apps can securely communicate using the state-of-the-art Noise Protocol over libp2p.

This [blog](https://blog.iota.org/iota-stronghold-beta-release/) published for the beat release of stronghold gives great insights to readers.

A general deeper introduction in the concepts is layed out in the [introduction article](https://blog.iota.org/iota-stronghold-6ce55d311d7c/)
