# The IOTA Tangle Network Explorer

A tool to display every activity in the IOTA Networks.

The official IOTA Explorer is hosted here:

- **[IOTA Tangle Explorer](https://explorer.iota.org/mainnet)** - for Mainnet, Legacy Mainnet and Chrysalis Testnet

and here:

- **[IOTA 2.0 DevNet Explorer](https://v2.iota.org/explorer)** - for the IOTA 2.0 fully decentralized DevNet

The Explorers can display live and historical Data of events and addresses in the IOTA networks.

The current supported and displayed networks are:

## Mainnet

The currently live and used Mainnet of IOTA. Implemented Protocol stage is Chrysalis (IOTA 1.5). This is the network where all real world-data and value transfers happen:

- **[Mainnet](https://explorer.iota.org/mainnet)**

## Testnet

Testnet used for further development of the current IOTA 1.5 Chrysalis Protocol. All transactions here use Testnet tokens without value. It is used by the community and the IOTA Foundation to test and develop applications and new features

- **[Testnet](https://explorer.iota.org/testnet)**

## Legacy Mainnet

This is the still active, but old Mainnet of the IOTA 1.0 Protocol implementation. The only transactions happening here are migrations of the tokens into the new IOTA 1.5 Maninnet of users that did not yet migrate their Tokens into the new network.

- **[Legacy Mainnet](https://explorer.iota.org/legacy-mainnet)**

## IOTA 2.0 Decentralized DevNet

The implementation of the upcoming fully decentralized IOTA 2.0 Protocol. The network here does not use or need a coordinator anymore. Used with Testnet tokens to fine-tune, test and optimize the upcoming development stage of the IOTA Protocol together with the IOTA community.
