# Network Visualizer

Network Visualizers show you the activity of messages happening in an IOTA Tangle in real-time. They are a powerful tool for the researchers to help analyze the complex structure and also often produce impressive and beautiful impressions of the so complex technology in IOTA. Many people find it fascinating to observe the Graph of messages grow and change under different network conditions.

IOTA provides visualizers in the Network explorer Websites for the following networks:

## Mainnet

The currently live and used Mainnet of IOTA. Implemented Protocol stage is Chrysalis (IOTA 1.5). This is the network where all real world-data and value transfers happen:

## Testnet

Testnet used for further development of the current IOTA 1.5 Chrysalis Protocol. All transactions here use Testnet tokens without value. It is used by the community and the IOTA Foundation to test and develop applications and new features

## Legacy Mainnet

This is the still active, but old Mainnet of the IOTA 1.0 Protocol implementation. The only transactions happening here are migrations of the tokens into the new IOTA 1.5 Maninnet of users that did not yet migrate their Tokens into the new network.

## IOTA 2.0 Decentralized DevNet

The implementation of the upcoming fully decentralized IOTA 2.0 Protocol. The network here does not use or need a coordinator anymore. Used with Testnet tokens to fine-tune, test and optimize the upcoming development stage of the IOTA Protocol together with the IOTA community.
