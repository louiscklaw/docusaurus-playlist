# IOTA Smart Contracts

The IOTA Smart Contract Protocol is IOTA's solution for running smart contracts on top of the IOTA tangle. With IOTA smart contracts, we bring scalable and flexible smart contracts into the IOTA ecosystem by allowing anyone to spin up a smart contract blockchain and anchor it to the IOTA tangle.

Allowing multiple blockchains to anchor to the tangle will solve several problems with smart contracts.

Read how IOTA smart contracts work in the [documentation](/smart-contracts/overview).

For a deep dive to fully understand the concepts, we recommend reading the [IOTA smart contracts whitepaper](https://files.iota.org/papers/ISC_WP_Nov_10_2021.pdf)
