# IOTA Streams

The IOTA Streams framework is intended to be a secure message verification and protection protocol for sending data over a given transport layer.

Streams is an organizational tool for structuring and navigating secure data through the Tangle. Streams organizes data by ordering it in a uniform and interoperable structure.

Read the [full documentation](/streams/welcome) of the streams framework to understand it better.
