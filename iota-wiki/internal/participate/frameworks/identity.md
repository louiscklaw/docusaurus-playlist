# IOTA Identity framework

The IOTA Identity framework implements the most common standards and patterns for Decentralized Identity in both a DLT agnostic and IOTA method specification manner. It is designed to work for Identity for People, Organizations, Things, and Objects acting as a unifying-layer of trust between everyone and everything.

A great overview is given in the article [Introduction to decentralized identity](/identity.rs/decentralized_identity) in our identity documentation here in the Wiki.
