# Getting Started

If you want to edit a document to elaborate on a topic or fix a typo, you can click "Edit this page" at the bottom of any article. It will redirect you to the relevant GitHub repository and open an editor with a user-friendly interface which will help you to submit your changes for a review. To learn more about git and GitHub, you can check the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com).
