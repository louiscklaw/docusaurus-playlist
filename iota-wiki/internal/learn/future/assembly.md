In December 2021, IOTA Foundation [introduced](https://blog.assembly.sc/announcing-assembly-and-the-asmb-token/) Assembly, a permissionless Smart Contracts network. Assembly will function as an intermediate layer for permissionless and interoperable Smart Contracts, and will have its own token called [ASMB](https://assembly.sc/token).
