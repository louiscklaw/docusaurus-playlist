# IOTA 2.0 DevNet Wallet

With a wallet for the IOTA 2.0 DevNet you can request tokens from the faucet, transfer them and create or manage NFTs and digital assets. Currently, there exist two wallets for the IOTA 2.0 DevNet. A Command Line Wallet (cli-wallet) and a GUI Wallet (IOTA 2.0 DevNet GUI Wallet)

## cli-wallet

The cli wallet is the most feature complete wallet. You can find a guide for it [here](/goshimmer/tutorials/wallet_library).
The cli wallet is located directly in the Goshimmer repo and pre-build binaries are released with each new GoShimmer version [here](https://github.com/iotaledger/goshimmer/releases).
