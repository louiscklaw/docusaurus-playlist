The possibilities and challenges of the Industrial Internet of Things have been investigated for years at the Laboratory for Machine Tools and Production Engineering WZL of RWTH Aachen University under the topic of Internet of Production (IoP). The IoP focuses on interdisciplinary optimization approaches along with the entire value chain, especially in the areas of data acquisition, machine learning and artificial intelligence. This article evaluates whether and how the vision of IoP can be extended to a Manufacturing Economy. Distributed ledgers in general, and IOTA in particular, were examined for this purpose. Subsequently, IoP potential use cases for the area of manufacturing technologies were outlined, but it turned out to have greater potential in manufacturing economy.
