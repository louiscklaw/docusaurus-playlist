To have the smoothest development and setup experience, you need to install a few things on your computer.
Please install these packages before you start the setup:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
3. [WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org/)
4. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Make sure that you have all these packages installed and ready to use on your system. To make sure that they work, run these commands:
- `node -v`
- `composer -v`
- `wp --info`
- `git --version`


If it doesn't return any errors, you are good to go.
