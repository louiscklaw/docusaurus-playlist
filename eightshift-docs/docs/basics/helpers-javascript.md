All JavaScript helpers can be imported from the `@eightshift/frontend-libs/scripts` folder, so you don't need to think about the internal folder structure of Eightshift Frontend Libs. If you want multiple functions imported just concatenate them in the import like this:

```js
import {
	camelize,
	checkAttr,
	props,
	...
} from '@eightshift/frontend-libs/scripts';
```
