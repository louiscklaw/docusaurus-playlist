If you are familiar with the extending classes (class inheritance) in PHP language, you can skip this chapter. For the rest, here are some awesome descriptions of how it works:

* [Interfaces](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.interfaces.php)
* [Dependency Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection)
* [Abstract Classes](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.abstract.php)
* [Object Inheritance](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.inheritance.php)
* [Namespaces](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.php)
