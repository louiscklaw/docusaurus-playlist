Block Transforms is an API that allows a block to be transformed from and to other blocks, as well as from other entities.

You can check the [WordPress documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/developers/block-api/block-transforms/) on this subject.

We didn't change anything regarding the original documentation; we simply provided you with the structured file where you can write all your transformations.

Please follow this [example](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-frontend-libs/blob/develop/blocks/init/src/Blocks/custom/heading/heading-transforms.js) for more inspiration.
