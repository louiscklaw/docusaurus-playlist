When you are working on a more complex WordPress project at one point, you will have to make a new Rest API route or add a new API field to the existing route, or something else.

We have prepared 4 interfaces:
* interface-callable-field.php
* interface-callable-route.php
* interface-route-security.php
* interface-route.php

and 2 abstract classes:
* class-base-field.php
* class-base-route.php

In general, you will use only what you need from the provided options.
