This class is used to create a new Rest API route.

To create a new class for the Rest API route, run this command:

`wp boilerplate create_rest_route`

The output will ask you to input the correct endpoint slug and method (`POST`, `GET`, etc.). Everything else will be done for you, setting the namespace, package, vendor prefixes, class, and folder name, and you will be set to write your field implementation in the `routeCallback` method.

## Test it in action

To test it in action, you should check the `wp-json` path in your browser. You can do that with something like this:

`domain.ext/wp-json/routeNamespace/routeVersion/routeName`

> This link will be different based on your project implementation.
